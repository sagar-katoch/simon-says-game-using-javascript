# Simon Says Game

A modern implementation of the classic Simon Says memory game built with vanilla JavaScript. This interactive web-based game challenges players to remember and reproduce increasingly complex sequences of colors.

## Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level adds a new color to the sequence
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, responsive design with visual feedback
- **Score Tracking**: Displays current level and final score
- **Animations**: Smooth button flash animations for both game sequence and user input
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when incorrect sequence is entered

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
